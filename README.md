# BMPUnityMapRender
Small project that convernts BMP map to unity meshes and optimes the meshes along the way, old a bit clumsy version of it written in C, new one in c++ is being developed

Program lets you draw provinces for strategy game in BMP format, then automatically converts it to objects in unity, so you don't have to create and shape them manualy

Currently unsuported, but still does the trick
